		<p>Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</p>
		
		<aside>If you have a captive audience, the experience is a little different.  For example, In Windows 8, HTML5 developers can rely on Internet Explorer 10's expanded HTML5 support to build user interfaces that run as Metro-style applications utilizing the WinRT API.  In this case, you know for a fact where your HTML5 will be rendered and by whom, and you are free to use the full set of HTML5 features IE10 supports without having to worry about other browser vendors and version.  Another example might be that someday you're building web-based intranet applications that will run inside of your enterprise on an Intranet.  In this case, your IT department may have standardized on a specific web browser.  If this is the case, you are free to use the HTML features supported by that specific vendor and version of web browser.</aside>
